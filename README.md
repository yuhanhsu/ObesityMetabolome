# ObesityMetabolome

The ObesityMetabolome GitHub provides example scripts used to perform the main analyses in the paper:

Hsu, YH, Astley, CM et al. Combining untargeted metabolomics, human genetics, causal inference, and pathway enrichment to define the obesity metabolome. Int J Obes (2020). [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32467615/)

A brief description of all scripts and examples of how to run them are provided in the documentation below. All input and output files are tab- or space-delimited plain text files, except for plots that are stored in PDF format. All scripts were tested using R v3.6.2 or Python v2.7.16; additional packages required to run each script are indicated within the documentation. We refer to Figure 1 in the paper to indicate where the scripts fit into our overall analysis plan. For analyses performed using pre-existing or external software, please refer to their respective publication and/or documentation: [PAIRUP-MS](https://github.com/yuhanhsu/PAIRUP-MS), [EPACTS](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/EPACTS), [METAL](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL_Documentation), [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/), [BOLT-LMM](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/BOLT-LMM/downloads/old/BOLT-LMM_v2.3.2_manual.pdf), and [MR-PRESSO](https://github.com/rondolab/MR-PRESSO/).

This GitHub also hosts meta-analyzed GWAS summary statistics with p < 1e-5 for the BMI-associated metabolites in the DataForPaper sub-directory.
